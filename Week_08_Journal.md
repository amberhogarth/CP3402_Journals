# Week 8

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learned how to build WordPress themes from scratch using Underscores.

[I watched certain sections of this LinkedIn Learning video to learn Underscores theme building.](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-themes-from-scratch-using-underscores-2) 

### Learning Experiment
Hypothesis:  
If I teach the learning material to someone else then my understanding will be enhanced because I can process the material in a more dynamic way than by studying by myself.
  
Test:  
1. Choose a topic to study. In my case, I chose PHP functionality.
2. Write 2 small tests for future testing, with the same concept but not the exact same questions.
3. Conduct a solo study session. Take notes, view online resources and tutorials and practice using PHP functions in a code editor.
4. Complete test 1.
5. Make a small lesson plan to teach the other person.
6. Conduct a teaching session. For mine, I presented PHP functions and tried to teach their functionality.
7. Complete test 2.

Results:   
For final results, compare the results of the two individual tests. In my case, I had a better understanding by the 2nd test, and that was reflected in my test results.
My results proved my hypothesis, as I gained a deeper understanding after I taught the content to someone else.

## Estimated Hours
Around 2 hours

## Content Insights
- It is recommended to build a theme from the top-down for organisation. Start with the header, and move down the page through the body, widgets, and footer.
- Flexbox is very useful in positioning content within containers. It allows developers to align items horizontally and vertically, rearrange their order and control their size dynamically.
- The site admin can use the customizer to change things such as the site title, tagline, primary colours and background colour.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I found that the learning experiment was able to prove something that I have always thought about myself; I am able to understand things better when I put them into teaching terms. I found that I solidified my understanding of PHP functionality by having to simplify and refine the concept to teach it to someone else. Through a bit of research, I found that there is a term for this style of learning. It is called the "Protégé Effect", as discussed in [this article.](https://scienceready.com.au/blogs/hsc-science-tips-advice/why-you-should-learn-by-teaching-the-protege-effect).
