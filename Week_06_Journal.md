# Week 6

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learned about agile meetings, with a focus on daily stand-up meetings.

[This LinkedIn Learning course outlines agile meetings.](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agile-at-work-driving-productive-agile-meetings/having-daily-stand-up-meetings-2)  

## Estimated Hours
Around 1 hour

## Content Insights
- The daily stand-up is a 15-minute meeting where developers are able to share and discuss their contributions. This is performed by the team every day. According to the learning resource above, the three questions asked in the daily standup are: 
"What did I do yesterday, what am I doing today, is there anything in my way?"  

- There are different personalities between team members, and these are apparent during daily stand-up meetings. One of these is "late-risers", which are members who are not able to focus early in the morning. For team members like this, the learning resource above recommends "Koosh ball". Doing activities like this can encourage the team members to be more aware and pay more attention to what is being discussed.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Daily stand-up meetings are widely-used among team-based work. I did some research to find out how many people find stand-up meetings effective and found the following report:
[Stray, V. et al. (2017) Are Daily Stand-up Meetings Valuable? A Survey of Developers in Software Teams](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316114233_Are_Daily_Stand-up_Meetings_Valuable_A_Survey_of_Developers_in_Software_Teams)
This resource details how agile methods like the daily stand-up meeting are mostly reported as having a positive impact on the programming skills of the participant and their peers. It is especially positive among younger participants.
This is interesting to me, and it shows that younger, more inexperienced team members benefit the most from stand-up meetings.
