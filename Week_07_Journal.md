# Week 7

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learned some basic PHP programming language. I also built an understanding about the Underscores starter theme for the assignment.

[I watched certain sections of this LinkedIn Learning video to learn some PHP basics.](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/php-with-mysql-essential-training-1-the-basics/)  

[This YouTube video helped me understand the different PHP files of the Underscores theme.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdTWGvP1k2Q&t=401s)  

## Estimated Hours
Around 2 hours

## Content Insights
- PHP is good for making large websites as it helps in reducing duplicated code and maintains consistency across multiple pages. Through the use of functions, classes and includes, code can be organised into reusable components to reduce redundancy.  

- PHP uses "include" statements which allow for code snippets, headers, footers or whole PHP files to be included in pages. This helps to maintain consistency across the website by making sure that changes made to included files are seen on all pages where they are included.

- The Underscores theme is a blank canvas for building custom WordPress themes. It includes the essential files and code necessary for a functioning theme, allowing for developers to add their own style, functionality and features.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I found out that being a WordPress Developer is a job, and decided to do research on it. [This page on indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/wordpress-web-developer) describes being a WordPress Developer as a "front-end or back-end developer" who "[creates] websites using WordPress and [relies] on various digital tools to create functional and enticing websites that attract users." The page details the following requirements for the job:  
  
- A bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field  
- Working knowledge of code languages such as jQuery, JavaScript, CSS and HTML  
- Keen understanding of WordPress and its various tools and resources
- Ability to do projects alongside a development team  
  
The page says the average annual salary of WordPress developers is $58.459 USD (89,827.75 AUD).
