# Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learned how to create a website using the Joomla CMS. I frequently used the "Take a Tour" function to learn how to use the back end of the CMS.

I referred to the following tutorial to gain an understanding of how to set up and use Joomla:
- https://websitesetup.org/build-website-with-joomla/

I also watched the following recommended learning course on LinkedIn Learning about WordPress:

## Estimated Hours
Around 3 hours

## Content Insights
- Joomla is a flexible way to manage web content from a central system. It is a way to edit websites in a simpler way, without having to rely on writing code.
- Joomla has a complicated back end interface, but is easier to understand with the built-in "Take a Tour" feature. 
- The CMS allows users to use templates which control the look and feel of your site and are easy to access online.

- WordPress is the most popular open-source CMS due to it being flexible and easy to use.
- In the LinkedIn Learning video mentioned above, WordPress is described as "an interface between the content publisher, a database and a server where content is stored, and the visitor who accesses that content through the web browser."

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After learning that WordPress was the most popular CMS, I was interested to know how popular Joomla is. 
I found some statistics which reveal that Joomla is "used by 2.5% of all the websites whose content management system we know. This is 1.7% of all websites." (https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-joomla)
Comparatively, WordPress is "used by 62.8% of all the websites whose content management system we know. This is 43.2% of all websites." (https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress)
From this, it can be concluded that Joomla, when compared with WordPress, is not a sought-after skill for employers.
