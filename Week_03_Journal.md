# Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learned how to use WordPress to build a website.

I referred to the following tutorial to learn how to download the platform "Docker" and locally host a WordPress site:

I brushed up on some of the basics of WordPress that I visited last week in the following course:

I studied workflows for WordPress projects in the recommended LinkedIn Learning course for this week:

## Estimated Hours
Around 2 hours

## Content Insights
- Docker uses "containers" for developing applications and software. The first resource mentioned above describes containers as "standardized units of software that package up your code and all of its dependencies."

- The WordPress block editor ("Gutenberg") is a feature of WordPress that simplifies content creation and editing. It allows you to easily edit, rearrange and customise blocks of content.

- Having a structured workflow by organising components of your work in a logical order is important for efficiency.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- WordPress is a very easy-to-use site, and although I learned about it through the LinkedIn Learning resources, I was happy to just navigate the site and explore different things on my own.
- I think it is important to explore things for yourself as well as learn through a tutorial or video. That way, you can not only improve your practical skills, but also improve your ability to learn self-sufficiently.
