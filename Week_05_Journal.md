## Content Insights
- Child themes are themes which inherit functionality and style of a "parent" theme. They allow you to make modifications to a theme without overriding its original files. This is important as modifying the files of a parent theme can cause issues when it is updated, as your modifications may be overwritten.

- In order to edit a child theme, you can "inspect" a website to find existing styles that you want to adjust. You then have to edit the style.css file for your child theme with your new style adjustments.

- Making a child theme is a great way to save time on creating styles and functionality of a website. An existing theme can just be adjusted to suit your website's individual needs.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I did some extra research to be able to simplify this prac task. There were several tutorials I skimmed through which required extra software to be downloaded in order to modify WordPress files. Eventually, I came across one tutorial which was a lot more straightforward; it  a plugin for creating and editing child themes. I have realised through this self-learning subject that I tend to put effort into finding simpler methods of completing tasks. Even if it takes extra time, I learned that I gravitate towards finding the simplest and shortest method.
