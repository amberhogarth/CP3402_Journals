## Content Insights
GitHub pages allows you to publish website projects easily. It is important to change directories and links to stylesheets when uploading to ensure style functionality.
HTML structure follows the structure of your webpage; code is easy to read and insert sections. ie. in <head></head>, you have <title></title> (in the header you have a title). HTML works with CSS and JavaScript to create pages. You can make forms in HTML for user input and customise with CSS.
CSS customises HTML code, including sizing, font, margins, positioning and colouring.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Website development seems to be an in-demand job, but what I can see is that a lot of the steps to developing websites can be easily automated. I imagine that people employed in web development use many tools to help them, and there is not so much individual html/other code customisation. I researched the automation of web development, and found that people use things such as build tools to compile codes/assets and package managers for libraries/software dependencies. This leads me to believe that web development may drop in demand as it becomes more automated.
